				Netflix’s Co-Founder Has 5 Pieces of Advice For Aspiring Entrepreneurs
			</h1>
			<p class="mt-5">
				Co-founder, Marc Randolph, used to answer the question of how they came
				up with the name Netflix. In a recent podcast interview with
				Mindvalley’s Vishen Lakhiani, Marc shared with us the story behind how
				Netflix went from concept to company. He traveled way back in time to
				when he and his eventual co-founder Reed Hastings would carpool in the
				Bay area and, every day, Marc would pitch Reed a new business idea. Some
				ideas were not so great — customized baseball bats and customized
				shampoo. Other ideas transformed into something much greater — Netflix.
				Marc Randolph was 38 years old when he started Netflix, but he had
				successfully launched over five ventures beforehand. Here are 5 pieces
				of advice from the co-founder of Netflix, a company founded in 1998,
				that is now generating over 20.16 billion USD in annual revenue.

			<h2>1. Start now and start small; never leave an idea in your head.</h2>
			There’s nothing more damaging to aspiring entrepreneurs than mere
			inaction. I can attest to this myself as I spent the entirety of my
			mid-twenties talking about starting a business, but I never did. In 2011,
			at a university competition, I delivered a two-minute elevator pitch about
			a food-delivery app, won second place, but I did nothing about it. All
			throughout my time working at Google, all I did with my close friends was
			entertain start-up ideas, but we never put them in action. That’s why, as
			soon as I resigned, my single top priority was to finally start a project
			on my own. And within one year of doing so, I witnessed the greatest
			professional and personal growth in my life. Here’s the single most
			important advice Marc Randolph has for you: Stop talking about your ideas
			or entertaining them in your head. Stop talking and start doing. “You have
			to figure out how to quickly, easily, and cheaply get your idea out of
			your head and collide it with reality.” Every idea you have in your head
			sounds like the next big thing. And the more you think about it, the
			bigger it becomes. But here’s a reality check: It isn’t. Your idea is
			incredibly flawed because it has yet to be subject to outside forces. It
			has yet to solve a person’s problem. <br /><br />
			So how do you start? In his chat with Vishen, Marc gives an example of a
			university student who once approached him with the idea to build a
			peer-to-peer clothing-rental business. His solution was quite simple. He
			asked her for a pen and a piece of paper and prepared a sign that read:
			“Need to borrow clothes? Knock.” He then told her to slap it on her
			dorm-room door and see what happens. Just by doing so, and within a few
			hours, she’ll be able to find out whether or not the idea is viable. If
			someone knocks, it is. How to apply this: Marc’s advice comes down to
			three simple steps: Get your flawed idea out of your head and put it on
			paper. Your idea doesn't need to be viable, as Marc explains, “it just
			needs to be something that stimulates what the problem is you’re really
			trying to solve.” Get over that fear that keeps you from starting. Here’s
			one small mental shift to help you do so. Get busy testing your idea so
			you can figure out the flaws in it. Once your idea is in public, as people
			engage with it, you begin to identify the flaws in it, which then allows
			you to reflect, reformulate, and rebuild. So don’t get lost in the
			branding just yet, prioritize shipping your product so you can further
			explore the validity of the problem it solves. “It’s a way to get started.
			If you’re waiting to hire someone, you’re wasting your time. If you’re
			waiting to complete some education, you’re wasting your time. If you’re
			waiting to raise money, you’re wasting your time. Start!” Your objective
			is to learn how people will engage with your idea to determine whether
			your core concept is viable. And you only learn so by testing.
			<p></p>
			<h2>
				2. The magic lies not in the idea, it lies in the testing process.
			</h2>
			This second lesson is the reason why Marc’s number one piece of advice for
			aspiring entrepreneurs is to just start; because once you do, you’ll come
			to realize that the magic does not lie in your idea, it lies in your
			testing process. “It’s not about having good ideas. It’s about the system,
			the process, and culture for testing lots of bad ones.” Implementation is
			everything. That’s exactly why James Clear has become so famous for saying
			that “you do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of
			your systems.” Likewise, in entrepreneurship, you do not rise to the level
			of your ideas, you fall to the level of your systems. This is another
			lesson I learned in my first year of entrepreneurship: You’re only as good
			as your systems and processes. And that’s exactly why in my second venture
			of building a writing business, the first thing I did was build myself a
			writing system that would allow me to rise to the level of my goals. How
			to apply this: In a fast-moving world, you need to move faster. Find a
			cheap, quick, and clever way to build systems that would allow you to
			continually test and retest your ideas. As Marc explains: “The trick is
			not having the idea. The trick is how quickly and how cheaply and how
			easily and how cleverly you can figure out a way to take an idea and test
			it.”
			<p></p>
			<h2>3. Culture is not what you say, it’s what you do.</h2>
			This lesson is short and simple, but it’s implications are profound. When
			asked about Netflix’s culture, Marc replied with this: “Culture is not
			what you say. Culture is what you do.” It’s not about your aspirations or
			inspirations, it’s about how you behave. How you carry yourself. How you
			treat yourself, your co-founder, your employees, and your customers. Stop
			talking about your principles, start modeling them. In essence, Marc’s
			words echo what Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of my favorite thinkers, wrote
			decades ago: “What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you
			say.” How to apply this: It’s really simple. Say what you’re going to do
			and be accountable for it.
