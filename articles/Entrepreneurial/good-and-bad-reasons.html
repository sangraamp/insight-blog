			<p class="mt-5">
				Recently we hosted a Q&A at Asana that I participated in with Ben
				Horowitz, Matt Cohler, and Justin Rosenstein. Marcus Wohlsen from Wired
				attended and wrote an article that discussed our views on the culture of
				entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. This is an important topic, so I
				want to take some time to clarify what we meant in this blog post.
				Before I do, I’d like to emphasize that we were talking exclusively
				about Silicon Valley culture and not the more general ‘small business
				entrepreneur.’ So for our audience at the time, entrepreneur meant
				“Silicon Valley startup technology entrepreneur.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Even given that context, it is notable that we all said you “probably”
				shouldn’t be an entrepreneur, not that you definitely shouldn’t. This is
				explicitly a directional position; we believe there are too many
				startups and entrepreneurs in the SV ecosystem, but that is very
				different from saying there shouldn’t be any. Many people think there
				should be more, and we are counterbalancing that view. Whenever you
				counterbalance an extreme view, you tend to also come off extremely, and
				certainly do in the media (which is related to the point I made about
				integration in my last post).
			</p>

			<p>
				The reason we like best for becoming an entrepreneur is that you are
				extremely passionate about an idea and believe that starting a new
				company is the best way to bring it into the world. The passion is
				important because entrepreneurship is hard and you’ll need it to endure
				the struggle, as well as to convince other people to help you. Believing
				that starting a new company is the best way to bring it into the world
				is important to ensure that resources—including most importantly your
				own time — are being put to the best possible use. If the idea is best
				brought into the world by an existing team, then it is tautologically
				optimal for the world for it to happen that way. Of course, not everyone
				is actually trying to optimize their impact, but many entrepreneurs are,
				by their own admission, and it is important for those people to consider
				this angle.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you’re not trying to maximize impact, then it seems like a reasonable
				assumption that you are instead optimizing around personal lifestyle
				preferences of some kind. You want total freedom to choose how you make
				your living, regardless of if it necessarily provide large amounts of
				value to other people or perhaps is even redundant with something that
				already exists. Or you want extreme flexibility in your schedule, maybe
				including the ability to stop working altogether for long periods of
				time at short notice. Or you want to work on a certain kind of problem
				or with certain kinds of people. For many kinds of preference, you
				likely can actually find a company able to give them to you, but
				certainly starting your own is a great shortcut and I personally think
				that’s totally reasonable. I like people who are seeking to have big
				impact on the world, but it is not the only path worth taking, and I
				have no reason to denigrate this type of entrepreneur.
			</p>
			<p>
				So with all that in mind, here are some of the bad reasons to become an
				entrepreneur that we were actually trying to speak to:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					You want to be your own boss in a big company. Evernote CEO Phil Libin
					put it well last year:
					<blockquote cite="Evernote CEO Phil Libin">
						“People have this vision of being the CEO of a company they started
						and being on top of the pyramid. Some people are motivated by that,
						but that’s not at all what it’s like. What it’s really like:
						everyone else is your boss – all of your employees, customers,
						partners, users, media are your boss. I’ve never had more bosses and
						needed to account for more people today. The life of most CEOs is
						reporting to everyone else, at least that’s what it feels like to me
						and most CEOs I know. If you want to exercise power and authority
						over people, join the military or go into politics. Don’t be an
						entrepreneur.”
					</blockquote>
				</li>
				<li>
					You think it’s glamorous. The media does a great job idolizing various
					entrepreneurs, crowning Kings and designating Godfathers of various
					mafias, but this is all colorful narrative. The reality is years of
					hard work, throughout which you usually have no idea if you’re even
					moving in the right direction.
				</li>
				<li>
					You believe you’re extremely talented and that this is the way to
					maximize your financial return on that talent. Why wouldn’t you want
					more of the cap table? This is flawed logic, since the 100th engineer
					at Facebook made far more money than 99% of Silicon Valley
					entrepreneurs. Small slices of gigantic pies are still themselves
					gigantic. If you’re extremely talented, you can easily identify a
					company with high growth potential and relatively low risk and get an
					aggressive compensation package from them. If you turn out to be wrong
					after a few years, you can try again. Within 2 or 3 tries, and likely
					on the first one, you’ll have a great outcome and can be confident you
					contributed serious lasting value to the world. If you instead try to
					immediately start “the next Google or Facebook”, there is a very high
					likelihood that you will fail completely, or be forced to settle for a
					much smaller outcome. It will take a long time to reach success or
					failure, so you won’t have many tries.
				</li>
				<li>
					You heard Paul Graham compared non-founders to animals at a zoo and
					don’t want to look like a chump (or a chimp). As Jeff Atwood points
					out, this is much more projection than fact. There are companies that
					feel like they were lifted out of a Dilbert cartoon and treat their
					employees terribly and then there are, you know, good companies. Work
					for one of those, or work for yourself, but definitely don’t work
					anywhere that you can describe as “soul-sucking”.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Yes, this viewpoint is somewhat self-serving. We want to hire the best
				at Asana, and many of the best are choosing to become entrepreneurs
				instead of applying at companies like ours. That said, we only need to
				hire a quite small number of those folks to ourselves succeed. The
				bigger concern is the macro effect of spreading talent too thinly across
				the board and the micro effect of people not spending their time in
				valuable ways. Zuck himself has speculated that Silicon Valley is not
				obviously the place he would start a company like Facebook today for
				exactly this reason. As to the micro effect, I like the way Justin puts
				it: “If you’re going to devote the best years of your life to your work,
				have enough love for yourself and the world around you to work on
				something that matters to you deeply”.
