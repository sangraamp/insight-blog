			<h1 class="mt-4">YC Build Sprint Winter 2021</h1>
			<p class="mt-5">
				We’re delighted to announce the launch of another YC Build Sprint
				through Startup School! It will begin on February 15 and end on March
				14. Signups just opened, so you can register for the sprint now.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Build Sprint is an opportunity for intense focus on your startup or
				side-project for a specific period of time. For existing startups, this
				may involve a push towards launching a specific feature or reaching a
				certain milestone. For new founders, this is an opportunity to take the
				plunge and begin work on a project that excites you.
			</p>

			<p>
				At the start of the sprint, you’ll register your four-week goal. As the
				sprint progresses, you’ll be able to track your progress, get feedback
				from YC group partners and team members, and have weekly meetings with
				other sprint participants to provide accountability. The sprint
				culminates with the YC application deadline.
			</p>
			<h2 class="mt-2 mb-2">Getting feedback from YC</h2>
			<p>
				One consistent request we get from Startup School participants and YC
				applicants alike is more feedback from the YC team. For the upcoming
				sprint, we’re committing to provide more founder feedback than ever
				before. Each week, we’ll issue a public challenge to sprint participants
				and give personalized feedback to those who participate. We’ll also have
				weekly calls with YC partners and experts that will answer participant
				questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, in a first for YC, we’ll provide actionable feedback on 1,0001
				YC S2021 applications submitted by sprint participants. Historically, we
				haven’t systematically provided personalized feedback on applications
				that don’t make it to the interview stage because of resource
				constraints. In the spirit of doing things that don’t scale, however,
				we’re going to get it done!
