				A frequent question we get at YC is “when do I start thinking about the
				FDA?” Obviously, there is no single answer to such a complex question,
				but here are some basic rules of thumb for how to think about it: It
				makes sense for every founder considering a bio product to get a basic
				FDA education from day one. Choosing the proper regulatory pathway is
				nuanced; research and experts can help. Correctly setting up your GxP
				process and running studies “the FDA way” at the right time is
				essential. Navigating the FDA process effectively is absolutely key for
				startups. If you invest too much too early, you may unnecessarily burn
				cash too fast.
			</p>
			<p>
				Conversely, if you start too late, you may have to redo work,
				potentially slowing down your process substantially. An analogy we often
				share with founders is that work done before investing in the FDA
				process is like sketching with pencil, while committing to the FDA
				process is like using ink. As you can imagine, planning your sketch and
				practicing it in pencil, and only then committing to ink, will lead to
				the best results. In our experience, we often see pre-product startup
				founders pursuing two simultaneous projects: Running a “killer”
				experiment that demonstrates that their product can work. Figuring out
				the appropriate FDA regulatory pathway for their product.
			</p>

			<p>
				Startups run these simultaneously because they’re interdependent and
				because the learnings from the killer experiment often help determine
				the proper regulatory pathway. Imagine you’ve been iterating on a novel
				therapeutic in vitro. Your killer experiment might be showing a
				therapeutic effect by doing an in-vivo experiment in a representative
				animal model. By getting some sense of the therapeutic effect and its
				mechanism, you can compare your therapeutic to others with similar
				safety profiles or that treat similar populations or diseases. This
				comparison process can help you choose the regulatory pathway that makes
				the most sense for the product.
