			<p class="mt-5">
				Running a biotech company is capital intensive, and this can make it
				intimidating to get started. Founders sometimes face a chicken and egg
				problem: how do you make progress without millions of dollars in
				funding, and how do you raise millions of dollars in funding without
				having made progress?
			</p>
			<p>
				However, it is quite possible today to start a biotech company on a
				shoestring budget ($0-$200k starting costs). Many successful biotech
				companies started in just this way.
			</p>

			<p>
				This post walks through three such stories, covering three biotech
				companies that are doing extremely well. Each example explains how they
				managed to get started and hit initial milestones with minimal funding
				or without any funding at all.
			</p>

			<p>
				Specifically, these case studies will demonstrate answers to the
				following questions:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Can you run initial experiments showing technical feasibility of your
					idea, like GeneWEAVE?
				</li>
				<li>
					If your target market will be very expensive to enter, can you
					repurpose your product to go after a smaller, more tractable market
					initially, like BillionToOne?
				</li>
				<li>
					Can you generate revenue upfront by providing services to other
					companies that are enabled by your technology, like Arpeggio?
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Finally, in a first for YC, we’ll provide actionable feedback on 1,0001
				YC S2021 applications submitted by sprint participants. Historically, we
				haven’t systematically provided personalized feedback on applications
				that don’t make it to the interview stage because of resource
				constraints. In the spirit of doing things that don’t scale, however,
				we’re going to get it done!
